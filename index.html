    Difference between Object.freeze(), Object.seal() and
    Object.preventExtensions()
  </h1>
  <h3>The Object.freeze() method</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This method completely freezes an object.</li>
    <li>
      It means that if an object is frozen, then we can’t add a new property to
      it,
    </li>
    <li>can’t update any existing property value,</li>
    <li>and we also can’t delete any existing properties.</li>
    <li>
      To check if an object is frozen, we can use the
      <code class="highlight">Object.isFrozen()</code> method.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>How to thaw/defrost a frozen object in Javascript?</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Nothing can be added to or removed from the properties set of a frozen
          object. Any attempt to do so will fail, either silently or by throwing
          a TypeError exception (most commonly, but not exclusively, when in
          strict mode).
        </li>
        <li>
          Values cannot be changed for data properties. Accessor properties
          (getters and setters) work the same (and still give the illusion that
          you are changing the value). Note that values that are objects can
          still be modified, unless they are also frozen.
        </li>
        <li>So, the only way this could be done is, by cloning the object.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Object.seal() Method</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code class="highlight">Object.seal()</code> Method seals an object. It
      means that if an object is sealed, then we can only update the value of
      existing properties, but we can neither delete any property nor add a new
      property.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>
        To check if an object is sealed, we can use the
        <code class="highlight">Object.isSealed()</code> method.
      </h4>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Object.preventExtensions() Method</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code class="highlight">Object.preventExtensions()</code> method prevents
      new properties from being added to an object but lets the existing
      property be updated or deleted.
    </li>
    <li>
      To check if an object is prevented from extensions, we can use the
      <code class="highlight">Object.isExtensible()</code> method.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Using strict mode</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When we use any three of the above methods on an object and later try to
      mutate it, it doesn’t work, but we also don’t get any console errors.
    </li>
    <li>When we use strict mode, it throws an error in such cases.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Working with nested objects</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The <code class="highlight">freeze()</code>,
      <code class="highlight">seal()</code>, and
      <code class="highlight">preventExtensions()</code> methods apply only to
      the first level of properties.
    </li>
    <li>
      If any nested objects are present in an object, then modifying the nested
      objects works as before.
    </li>
    <li>
      So to apply these methods to all nested objects, we need to make recursive
      calls and apply these methods to each level of objects individually.
    </li>
  </ul>
